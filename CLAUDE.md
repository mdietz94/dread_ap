# CLAUDE.md — context for the next session

Fast-load brief for picking up **dread_ap** cold. This is the Metroid Dread
sibling of [smo_archipelago](../smo_archipelago/CLAUDE.md). The shape mirrors
that project's two-tier architecture — read its CLAUDE.md for the parent
pattern; this file only documents what's different for Dread.

## What we're building

A real Archipelago client for **Metroid Dread 2.1.0 on a modded Switch
(Atmosphere CFW)**, with Ryujinx as the dev iteration target. Builds on
Randovania's existing Dread infrastructure:

- [open-dread-rando-exlaunch](https://github.com/randovania/open-dread-rando-exlaunch) — the in-game sysmodule that exposes a Lua-eval TCP socket on port 6969
- [open-dread-rando](https://github.com/randovania/open-dread-rando) — the RomFS patcher (soft-forked here to consume AP slot_data)
- [mercury-engine-data-structures](https://github.com/randovania/mercury-engine-data-structures) — file format library (pip dep)

**The headline architectural fact**: unlike smo_archipelago, we write zero
Switch-side C++ code and do zero Ghidra work. Randovania did it for us. The
entire problem reduces to (a) a Python translator from Archipelago to the
existing Lua-eval protocol, and (b) an adapter that makes
open-dread-rando consume an AP-shaped seed.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Never commit Nintendo IP

Same rule as smo_archipelago. The Dread-specific list:

- `*.nsp`, `*.nca`, `*.xci`, `*.nso`, `*.npdm` — raw Switch dumps
- `prod.keys`, `dev.keys`, `title.keys` — console keys
- `*.bmsad`, `*.bmsld`, `*.bmscd`, `*.bmsbk`, `*.brfld`, `*.brsa`, `*.bmtre`, `*.bmsem`, `*.bmtun` — Mercury Engine scenario / actor / behavior data
- `*.bfres`, `*.bcskla`, `*.bwav`, `*.szs`, `*.byml`, `*.msbt` — model / animation / audio / config / text
- `*.lc` — Lua bytecode (Mercury Engine compiles its Lua to bytecode)
- `.romfs-cache/`, `romfs-extracted/`, `out/` — extraction caches and per-seed patcher output

All gitignored. Treat any pasted excerpt from these files in commit messages
or doc comments as the same exposure as the file itself.

**Safe pattern**: functional identifiers (scenario names like `s010_cave`,
actor names from Randovania's published JSON) are OK. Bulk-extracted Nintendo
strings are not.

## Architecture (three tiers)

```
[ Switch / Dread 2.1.0 ]  <--TCP/binary LAN-->  [ PC Client (Python) ]  <--ws-->  [ AP server ]
   exlaunch sysmodule                              DreadContext(CommonContext)     archipelago.gg
   (UPSTREAM — no fork)                            Kivy GUI
   - bootstraps RL.* Lua namespace                 LuaProtocol on port 6969
   - opens TCP :6969                               Forked apworld machinery
   - runs arbitrary Lua via PACKET_REMOTE_LUA_EXEC
   romfs/
   (our forked open-dread-rando output)
```

## Wire protocol (exlaunch, port 6969)

Lifted verbatim from [randovania/game_connection/executor/dread_executor.py](https://github.com/randovania/randovania/blob/main/randovania/game_connection/executor/dread_executor.py)
and [randovania/game_connection/connector/dread_remote_connector.py](https://github.com/randovania/randovania/blob/main/randovania/game_connection/connector/dread_remote_connector.py).
Both are MIT.

**Packet types** (the upstream `IntEnum(b"N")` trick evaluates as `int("N")==N`,
so on the wire these are raw `0x01`..`0x09`, not ASCII):

| Code | Name | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| 0x01 | PACKET_HANDSHAKE | both |
| 0x02 | PACKET_LOG_MESSAGE | Switch→PC |
| 0x03 | PACKET_REMOTE_LUA_EXEC | both |
| 0x04 | PACKET_KEEP_ALIVE | both |
| 0x05 | PACKET_NEW_INVENTORY | Switch→PC |
| 0x06 | PACKET_COLLECTED_INDICES | Switch→PC |
| 0x07 | PACKET_RECEIVED_PICKUPS | Switch→PC |
| 0x08 | PACKET_GAME_STATE | Switch→PC |
| 0x09 | PACKET_MALFORMED | Switch→PC |

Request frames (PC → Switch):

**Lua-exec request**: `[0x03][4-byte LE length][utf-8 source]`
**Handshake request**: `[0x01][1 interest byte]` (no length; multiworld interest = `0x02`)
**Keep-alive request**: `[0x04]` (one byte, no reply)

Response frames (Switch → PC) — every frame begins with a 1-byte
PacketType, then the layout varies by type:

**HANDSHAKE reply** `[0x01][req_num:1]` (2 bytes; no body)
**REMOTE_LUA_EXEC reply** `[0x03][req_num:1][success:1][len:3 LE u24][payload]`
**Push frames** (0x02/0x05/0x06/0x07/0x08) `[type:1][len:4 LE u32][payload]`
**MALFORMED** `[0x09][failing_type:1][rcv:4 LE u32][should:4 LE u32]`

This is the AUTHORITATIVE wire format, confirmed from
`vendor/open-dread-rando-exlaunch/source/program/{remote_api.cpp,main.cpp}`.
Prior versions of this document described the response shape as
`[success][len_24][payload]` for all frames — that was wrong (see
[docs/wire-wiring-notes.md](docs/wire-wiring-notes.md)).

**Connect sequence**:
1. Open TCP to switch:6969
2. Send `PACKET_HANDSHAKE` with multiworld interest
3. Read response
4. Send Lua-exec: `return string.format('%d,%d,%s,%s,%s', RL.Version, RL.BufferSize, tostring(RL.Bootstrap), Init.sLayoutUUID, GameVersion)`
5. Read response, split on `,` → `(api_version, buffer_size, bootstrap, layout_uuid, game_version)`
6. (Optional in our case — already done by exlaunch + Randovania-patched ROM) Send bootstrap Lua files
7. Start poll loop: every 2.0s send `Game.AddSF(2.0, RL.UpdateRDVClient, "")` initially, then the Lua side keeps re-scheduling itself

**RL namespace** (the Lua API exposed by the bootstrap files):

| Lua call | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `RL.GetInventoryAndSend()` | Reads `RandomizerPowerup.GetItemAmount()` per tracked item; replies with `PACKET_NEW_INVENTORY` |
| `RL.GetCollectedIndicesAndSend()` | Reads Blackboard pickup-collected bits; replies with `PACKET_COLLECTED_INDICES` |
| `RL.GetReceivedPickupsAndSend()` | Reads `Blackboard.GetProp(playerSection, "ReceivedPickups")`; replies with `PACKET_RECEIVED_PICKUPS` |
| `RL.ReceivePickup(message, cls, progression_string, num_pickups, inventory_index)` | Grants an item live by calling the game's native `OnPickedUp` callback |
| `RL.UpdateRDVClient(arg)` | Periodic 2s poller — fires the three queries above + game state |
| `Game.GetCurrentGameModeID()` | Game state read (title vs in-game vs paused) |
| `Init.bBeatenSinceLastReboot` | Goal detection — flips true after the final cutscene completes |

## Decisions already made (and why)

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| **No subsdk module of our own** | Randovania already shipped one (exlaunch). Writing a parallel one duplicates work and forks the community. Only revisit if exlaunch lacks a hook we genuinely need. |
| **No Ghidra work** | Implied by the above. If we ever reach for it the plan needs revisiting — that signals exlaunch is insufficient for the use case. |
| **Soft fork w/ credit, not pip-install dependency** | Upstream's release cadence is monthly, AP-relevant patches will likely lag. Vendored fork lets us iterate, with a discipline of filing genuine bugs upstream. |
| **Target Dread 2.1.0 (not 1.0.0)** | Newest. Already dumped. Randovania has actively shifted here. |
| **PC client, not direct Switch→AP** | Same reasoning as smo_archipelago — websocket+deflate+TLS+reconnect on Switch is months of work; PC bridge solves it via `CommonContext`. |
| **No deathlink/hints/traps for v0.1** | MVP discipline. Land item flow + goal first. |

## Status

Phase 1 deliverable: [scripts/phase1_validate.py](scripts/phase1_validate.py).
Run with `python scripts/phase1_validate.py <switch-ip>` after installing
upstream exlaunch on the Switch. Exit status 0 means the wire is up and
the rest of the plan can proceed. Non-zero status means stop and triage.

Logic: M2 plumbing Gate A + Gate B shipped. All 137 actor pickups have
non-trivial rules; 184 events are real AP items locked to synthetic
event locations; the lambda compiler's event branch consults
`state.has("Event: <name>", player)`; completion_condition reads
`victory_condition` from compiled output. Gate B: cross-region access is
modeled via a global-reachability `region_access` map (item-only — see the
notes retro for why) that gates `Menu→region`, so boss/EMMI locations are no
longer trivially reachable; Trick Level is a user option backed by three
pre-baked `compiled_rules{,_l2,_l3}.json`. The compiler is now deterministic
(stable disjunct-cap tie-break). Generation smoke produces a solvable seed
under `accessibility: minimal` across trick levels and DNA configs.
Negation handling was made faithful (config-`misc` flags resolved against our
config; temporal negated item/event → drop-the-transient = impossible, relying
on the stable post-event path; self-referential event rules stripped). Starting
items (Slide, Pulse Radar, missile capacity) are now `push_precollected` into AP
logic. `accessibility: items`/`full` NOW WORK (verified 8/8 across seeds at every trick
level). The compiler uses a forward resolver (`compile_forward` in
scripts/extract_dread_rules.py) that INLINES events into ITEM-ONLY rules — each
event atom is replaced by that event's item-only reach cost, computed in
dependency-sphere order. This removes events from the dependency graph, so the
old item↔event bootstrap cycle (which AP's monotonic `fulfills_accessibility`
sweep couldn't unwind) is gone, and the rules bootstrap like ordinary AP item
logic. Events are therefore NO LONGER AP items/locations (World/Regions/Rules
skip them; data tables keep them for ID stability). Two more pieces were
required: a classification fix (Missile Tank was `filler`, Missile+ Tank /
Flash Shift Upgrade / Speed Booster Upgrade were `useful` — all logic-required,
now progression(_skip_balancing)), and ONE forced starting item, Charge Beam
(`World.EXTRA_STARTING_ITEMS`, precollected + in the patcher starting_items),
the minimal set that clears the fill bottleneck. region_access is a star (cost
inlined per-rule). Smoke seed is now `accessibility: items`. See the notes retro
for the full diagnosis.

Wire wiring: Gate A + B shipped. Every Switch→PC frame is now
demuxed by leading type byte; the wire format documented previously
in this file (and in phase1_validate.py) was WRONG — actual format
discovered from `vendor/open-dread-rando-exlaunch/source/program/`
and now used throughout. The Switch→AP path emits
`LocationChecks` from `PACKET_COLLECTED_INDICES` pushes
(`locations:`-prefixed bitfield → AP location_ids via the new
`pickup_index` field on `locations.json`). The PC→Switch path was
already wired. `DreadWorld.generate_output` writes a per-slot
placements JSON; `scripts/seed_to_patcher_overrides.py` converts
that to the override shape `scripts/build_patcher_json.py` consumes.
2-slot Dread+Clique fixture lives at
`apworld/dread/tests/seeds/dread_clique.yaml`. End-to-end
runbook at [docs/e2e-runbook.md](docs/e2e-runbook.md); wire-wiring
retrospective at [docs/wire-wiring-notes.md](docs/wire-wiring-notes.md).
Options: beyond StartingArea/IncludeBossPickups, the apworld now exposes
TrickLevel, a Metroid DNA collection goal (RequiredArtifacts 0-12 +
ArtifactPlacement), and cosmetic/combat passthrough (HUD toggles, room-name
display, death counter, Raven Beak damage table, nerf power bombs). Energy /
environmental-damage settings are intentionally NOT exposed (they need the
v0.3 damage model). DNA `Metroid DNA k` items map to `ITEM_RANDO_ARTIFACT_k`
and ride the normal item paths; non-actor (boss/EMMI) pickups are keyed by
`pickup_lua_callback`. 206 tests pass (157 apworld + 49 scripts; 1 pre-existing
vendor-fixture test needs the open-dread-rando checkout). Apworld now slugged
`0.0.1-phase4-logic-m2-gateB-options` (world_version 0.2.0).

Outstanding (non-blocking for v0.1): `accessibility: items` (~13 events with
impossible area-relative rules — compiler fidelity, see the notes retro);
inlining event/damage cost into region_access; per-trick-category granularity;
door/elevator randomization. Real-hardware end-to-end run on a Switch is the
next manual gate. Kivy GUI is a separate later milestone.

## Known unknowns / risks for new work

1. **Cutscene-blocked item delivery.** `RL.GivePendingPickup` no-ops during cinematics. Lift the pending-queue + post-HELLO replay pattern from `smo_archipelago/apworld/smo_archipelago/client/state.py`.

2. **Lua-eval poll latency (2s floor).** Acceptable for v0.1; revisit only if AP async features (deathlink) need it.

3. **`starting_location` regression** in MuratDev41's earlier AP fork — likely a Randovania `PatcherData` schema change between versions. Diff before assuming an AP-specific cause. See PLAN.md risk #6.

4. **Upstream RL.* API churn.** Pin to a specific exlaunch commit hash; smoke-test with `RL.Version` assertion at connect (already done by the Phase 1 script).

## Test commands worth knowing

```pwsh
# Phase 1 wire validation
cd C:\Users\maxwe\Documents\dread_ap
python scripts\phase1_validate.py <switch-ip>

# Once apworld lands:
python -m pytest apworld\dread\tests\ -v
```
